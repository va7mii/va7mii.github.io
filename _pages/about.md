My name is Kevin Zhang. I am currently an undergraduate studying integrated engineering (computer and mechanical focused) at [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/), with a deep passion for aerospace, AI, and medicine. 

I currently work on projects to learn about robotics and generative AI. In addition, I spend time learning new things like water-jet cutting and wielding provided by the [integrated engineering machine shop](https://ubcigenshop.notion.site/Welcome-to-UBC-s-Integrated-Engineering-Workshop-795ac7a00da94b7faed1ebb51d622016).

I am also currently as a software-defined radio developer for [UBC Orbit Satellite Design Team](https://www.ubcorbit.com/). We are currently developing a CubeSat, with Simon Fraser University, as part of [European Space Agency's Fly Your Sat! program](https://www.esa.int/Education/CubeSats_-_Fly_Your_Satellite/New_missions_selected_for_the_fourth_edition_of_the_Fly_Your_Satellite!_programme), which will be launched in 2025. Our satellite, ALEASAT, will be serve to take photos in space and thus to assist amateur radio operators (like me) with satellite imagery for disaster relief. 

When I'm not studying, I like to snowboard at Grouse and Whistler and I am also currently training to get my CASI Level 1. I also spend time doing cycling, bouldering, and swimming.
